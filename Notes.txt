Need to make it so that units can't occupy same space
Need to make units move toward destination in straight line (instead of Y first, then X)
Need to change cursor when selecting unit to attack, so that know you did an attack command vs a move command
Need to show unit health bar
Need to have death animation

Human controlled units need to have automatic attack mode

Need to be able to multiselect units

Need to slow down game speed (or make it adjustable)

Need to enable scenario where user can drag select all units, attack a specific target, then move on the next target after that, and thereby win.

Enemy need to attack closest gdi unit

If enemy is attacking unit X and then unit Y moves closer, enemy needs to attack unit Y instead
(i.e enemy needs to pay attention to current state and adjust if it makes sense)

The View objects shouldn't hold the constants for shp file mapper and file name
