Needed features/improvements
-----------------------------
Need to make it so that units can't occupy same space

Need to change cursor when selecting unit to attack, so that know you did an attack command vs a move command
Need to show unit health bar
Need to have death animation

Human controlled units need to have automatic attack mode

Need to be able to multiselect units

Need to slow down game speed (or make it adjustable)

Need to enable scenario where user can drag select all units, attack a specific target, then move on the next target after that, and thereby win.

Enemy need to attack closest gdi unit

If enemy is attacking unit X and then unit Y moves closer, enemy needs to attack unit Y instead
(i.e enemy needs to pay attention to current state and adjust if it makes sense)

The View objects shouldn't hold the constants for shp file mapper and file name

Coordinates system terms
------------------------
(Below examples assumes world size of width: 26 squares, height: 24 squares, with map square being width and height of 24)


World Coordinates - x,y, Where they click in the game world (range of (26 * 24) x (24 * 24))
Screen Coordinates - x,y, where they click on screen (range of 1920 x 1080)
World Map Square Coordinates - x,y, the map square as x,y coordinates.  Range of 26 x 24
World Map Square Index -  the index of the map square, single number, range of 0 to 26*24
Map Square Coordinates - x,y relative to a map square, where 0,0, is top left of that map square, and (mapsquarewidth,mapsquareheight) is bottom right
	(not sure what existing map square width and height are....)
Sprite Coordinates - x,y, relative to the top left of the sprite
