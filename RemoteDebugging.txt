Here are the steps I did to get remote debugging working, including running of the Spock tests from mike-and-conquer-test:

Installed Visual Studio 2015 on remote computer
Got app running from Visual Studio 2015 on remote computer
Followed instructions here to then setup remote debugging:  http://gpriaulx.co/2015/12/visual-studio-2015-remote-debugging/
Set username and password the same on both machines
	(can setup autologin using this:  https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee872306.aspx)


Open up the proper Rest endpoints on the Windows box in question, with this command:
	(Run command prompt as administrator)
	netsh http add urlacl url=http://*:11369/ user=mduvall

	Update this documentation to make it clear this has to be done we fresh machine install
	Also update to tell that you need to login to the remote machines before the network connection will work
		Connect to \\192.168.0.195\buildoutput in xyplorer or file explorer

	Need to run this one both local box(for running locally) and remote box(for running remotely)

	You can later delete this permission if needed with:
		netsh http delete urlacl http://*:11369/mac/

	To show permissions:
		netsh http show urlacl


For running mike-and-conquer-test Spock tests against remote instance, need to open up firewall on remote machine:

	Add firewall rule:
		netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open port 11369 for mike-and-conquer remote test running" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=11369

	To remote the same rule:
		netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Open port 11369 for mike-and-conquer remote test running" protocol=tcp localport=11369
