Here are the steps I did to get remote debugging working, including running of the Spock tests from mike-and-conquer-test:

Installed Visual Studio 2015 on remote computer
Got app running from Visual Studio 2015 on remote computer
Followed instructions here to then setup remote debugging:  http://gpriaulx.co/2015/12/visual-studio-2015-remote-debugging/
Set username and password the same on both machines
	(can setup autologin using this:  https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee872306.aspx)


Open up the proper Rest endpoints on the Windows box in question, with this command:
	(Run command prompt as administrator)
	netsh http add urlacl url=http://*:11369/ user=mduvall
		- Need to run this on both local box(for running locally) and remote box(for running remotely)


	You can later delete this permission if needed with:
		netsh http delete urlacl http://*:11369/mac/

	To show permissions:
		netsh http show urlacl

Alos need to manually connect to the remote machine before the network connection will work
		Connect to \\192.168.0.195\buildoutput in xyplorer or file explorer

For running mike-and-conquer-test Spock tests against remote instance, need to open up firewall on remote machine:

	Add firewall rule:
		netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open port 11369 for mike-and-conquer remote test running" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=11369

	To remote the same rule:
		netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Open port 11369 for mike-and-conquer remote test running" protocol=tcp localport=11369
