Possible algorithm:


Render to "screen texture" instead of screen

	Render terrain
	Render shadows of trees as green
	Render shadows of units as green
	Render trees (possibly overwriting green shadows)
	Render units (possibly overwriting green shadows)

	Make final pass of entire "screen bitmap", mapping any remaining green to shadow

Draw "screen texture" to screen



OR

	Render shadows of units(as shadows)
	Render units (possibly overwriting shadows)
	Render trees (possibly overwriting shadows)

Render to "screen texture" instead of screen

	Render terrain
	Render shadows of trees(as shadows)
	Render units, with their shadows mapped
	Render trees, overwriting tree shadows, and units and their shadows
