Can use XCC Mixer to extract files as WAV, but they sound scratchy to me when I do that





Used this program: https://www.ppmsite.com/osbigeditorinfo/ to extract sounds from remastered collection
        Using instructions here:  https://gamesgds.com/command-conquer-remastered-collection-how-to-extract-music-and-modify-dll-files/
Used file:
	\steamapps\common\CncRemastered\Data\SFX2D_EN-US.MEG

Extracted to wav.  Then used audacity to convert to MP3, variable encoding

That seemed to work to play as sound effect.  Had to make it sound effect, not song, in content importer

Extracted sound effecs to:  D:\Dropbox\Personal\ZZZ-Local\PersonalProgramming\mike-and-conquer\extracted sounds
